Biomedical data sits at the intersection of life, systems, and signal. It’s inherently messy — shaped by biology, behavior, instruments, institutions, and everything in between.

Through UCLA *machine learning with application in biomedicine course*, I’ve had firsthand exposure to working with genomic datasets - beginning to understand how raw sequences become structured information. 

I’m preparing to explore signal processing techniques for EEG, and other time-series data — a world where noise is as present as meaning, and clarity doesn’t come from removing complexity, but learning how to listen through it.

What fascinates me is how **technical decisions reflect human assumptions**. The choice of a normalization method, the design of a feature set, the loss function — these aren’t just tools. They encode values. In a medical context, those choices can shape diagnoses, risks, access, and outcomes.


I’m especially interested in:
- How we preprocess biological noise without erasing outliers who matter
- How we model risk without reinforcing structural bias
- How we enable clinicians, researchers, and patients to actually interpret the models they’re using

Right now, I’m building toward a master’s capstone that brings these questions into sharper focus — likely around genomic or physiological signal data.

I don’t have final answers, but I’m learning to ask better questions.
