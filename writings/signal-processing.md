Signal processing is the bridge between raw, messy input and meaningful insight — especially when that input comes from the body or brain.

I first got interested in it through exploring **[brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)](bci.html)**, where signals like EEG (electroencephalography) are used to infer intention, attention, or activity. These signals are noisy, high-frequency, and deeply entangled with motion, muscle tension, and environment — which means **everything depends on how you clean, filter, and interpret the signal.**

Right now, I’m starting to explore:
- How signal processing is applied to **EEG, EMG**, and **ECG** in clinical and research contexts

Signal processing shows up not just in BCIs, but in:
- Medical diagnostics (ECG, EEG, ultrasound)
- Speech and audio recognition
- Wearable tech and real-time biometrics
- Any system where analog meets digital and meaning needs to be extracted from noise

I’m early in this journey, but what draws me in is how signal processing sits at the **edge of data and perception** — a way of listening to what the body is trying to say, without flattening it into silence or artifacts.
