One of the greatest challenge I had faced in life is in accessing information. 

In China, the obstacle I faced was a digital wall to outside information and censorship. In America, the problem seemed to be the opposite - being given irrelevant information. 

Beyond the structural and systemic barriers, I found out in my twenties that I had been neurodiverse - I am dyslexic (reading difficulty) and autistic (socializing difficulty). The "category" does not define me but it does help me understand the unique challenges I face to receive information. I use text-to-voice softwares nowadays to assist with reading and I learn social cues and practice socializing consciously. 

With my experience came the belief that technology should enable access that helps people not only for survival but thriving as well. 

I would like to distill information and serve clarity in life. 

Don't be discouraged if you cannot find what you need from here. My advice is, seeing the path as the goal is helpful and as long as you keep going, the right information and people will find you.
