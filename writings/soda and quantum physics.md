Happy World Quantum Day! 

a little story to bust some self-help myths about quantum physics — and how it helped me see possibility differently.

one time, i told someone—very gently—that drinking soda every day is like sipping acidic water and slowly killing yourself.

they got instantly offended.  
“you know what really kills people?” they snapped. “negativity.”

then they cited that plant study—you know the one—where if you speak badly to a plant, it withers. and suddenly it felt like my words had personally triggered oxidative stress in their body.

💭 but does that reasoning hold up?

not so much — at least, not in **quantum mechanics**.

today, i was revisiting the hydrogen atom, in celebration of the world quantum day, and here's what i learned that could help illustrate why that reasoning does not hold up:  
every elegant, complex **wavefunction cloud**—from (2,0,0) to (4,3,3)—is a **solution to the same equation**, the famous _Schrödinger equation_, for _one single electron_ around _one single proton_.

that’s all hydrogen is.

but that one electron? it doesn’t live in a neat little orbit like planets around the sun. instead, it exists in a **cloud of possibility**.

its presence is described by a wavefunction \\(\psi\\), and what we see as “the cloud” is actually \\(\|\psi\|^2\\) — a **probability density**, showing where the electron is likely to be.


<div style="border-left: 4px solid #1e90ff; background-color: #eaf4ff; padding: 1em; margin: 1em 0; border-radius: 6px;">
  <p style="margin-top: 0; font-weight: bold;  color:rgb(39, 40, 41);">
    <strong>Note:</strong> why does the wavefunction \(\psi\) give us a probability density when we take \(|\psi|^2\)?
  </p>
  <p>
    this needs a little understanding of complex functions in math. in short, \(\psi\) has both phase (an imaginary part) and magnitude, but probability must be real and positive. we define the <em>complex conjugate</em> \(\psi^*\) and multiply: \(\psi^* \psi = |\psi|^2\), which is always real and positive.
  </p>
</div>






and here’s the catch: the cloud has structure.

there are dense zones (likely outcomes), and **nodes**—places where the probability of finding the electron is exactly _zero_. this isn’t random. it’s not wishful thinking. it’s **math**. it’s governed by quantum numbers ($n$, $\ell$, $m$) and the very shape of the universe.

👁️ **observation** doesn’t _create_ reality. it _collapses_ __structured possibility__ into one actual outcome.

and even if you don’t know that structure is there?  
doesn’t matter.  
your awareness or “positive vibes” don’t change the wavefunction.

this matters. because in pop science and self-help, we often confuse **attention** with **influence**. but not knowing something doesn’t protect you from it. and knowing it doesn’t guarantee it’ll happen either.

☢️ take $E = mc^2$.  
that’s rest energy — the amount of energy just _existing_ mass carries.

but when we talk about the energy of an electron in hydrogen, we’re not using $E = mc^2$. we’re solving for **binding energy** using the Schrödinger equation. the energy of a 1s electron is about **−13.6 eV** — not because of its mass, but because of the **electrostatic force** between it and the proton.

that energy is what gives the **probability cloud its shape**.

and yes — in more complex atoms or ions like H⁻ (with two electrons), things get messy. now, those electrons **interact and become entangled**. their wavefunction can't even be split into independent parts — one for each electron — because their fates are entangled. you can still write it in terms of magnitude and phase, but it’s not just one electron’s story anymore. (i'm still learning the math behind it — it’s complex, but definitely not arbitrary.) 

> note, hydrogen ion has entangled electrons that prevents us from writing the wavefunction neatly, but not all entangled electrons are ions, they could be other atoms as well. it leads to "spooky action in a distance" as Einstein puts it. 

and that brings me back to something i wrote today:

> reality isn’t made from certainty, but from __shaped uncertainty__.

this sentence has been bouncing around my head. because it’s true for electrons, but also for us.

life doesn’t collapse into a single outcome because we thought the right thought.  
but it also doesn’t collapse randomly.  
it collapses from a **cloud of structured possibility**.

✨ maybe wisdom is learning to sense the shape of your own probability cloud — to accept its nodes and dense zones — and stop blaming “negativity” every time the wavefunction collapses.

and the truth also is, drinking acidic water is not a healthy long term choice, whether this fact is brought to your attention, or not.
