My relationship with machine learning started in a practical context — working on real-world, messy datasets in a biomedical setting. Through coursework at UCLA, I’ve worked with supervised and unsupervised learning techniques applied to genomic and clinical data.

What’s become clear to me is that machine learning isn’t just about fitting models — it’s about *deciding what questions to ask, what assumptions to make, and what signals matter in the presence of noise*.

I’ve worked with:
- Logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods for classification tasks
- K-means clustering and PCA for dimensionality reduction and unsupervised exploration
- Evaluation strategies like cross-validation and ROC analysis in imbalanced datasets

I’m currently preparing to explore [deep learning](deep-learning.html) and signal-based modeling — and thinking more about how we balance performance with interpretability in high-stakes domains like healthcare.

### What I’m Thinking About:
- How can we make ML models **interpretable and accessible** to the people who use them?
- What kinds of bias enter through feature selection, preprocessing, or default assumptions?
- How can machine learning be **context-aware**, not just data-hungry?
