Founded in December 2021, Rono Dumplings was my attempt to build a CPG dumpling brand, starting with a ghost kitchen to test recipes and gather customer feedback through lean startup methodology.

## What I Built

**Ghost Kitchen Operations**
- Multi-platform distribution across ChowNow, UberEats, DoorDash, Grubhub
- South LA location with 7-day operation schedule
- Direct customer relationships achieving 4.2/5 Yelp rating through quality focus

**Full-Stack Business Development**
- **Brand & Marketing**: Designed logo, branding, website copywriting, and social media strategy
- **Operations**: Configured Toast POS system, managed supplier relationships, scaled recipes to production
- **Financial Management**: LLC formation, pass-through taxation, accounting, and 40K revenue with 17K COGS management
- **Product Strategy**: Menu design, photography, and multi-channel distribution across 5+ platforms

## Key Challenges & Learning

**Location Strategy**: Learned that "cheap rent" doesn't account for delivery logistics, safety, or operational efficiency. The South LA location created unexpected friction in customer acquisition and delivery partner relationships.

**Crisis Management**: Developed systematic inventory tracking and customer communication protocols after early operational failures taught me the importance of transparent, proactive stakeholder communication.

**Customer Intelligence**: Discovered through order analysis that vegetarian dumplings had unexpected popularity among Black and Muslim customers, leading to expanded vegan offerings and targeted community outreach.

**Event Catering**: Successfully executed 300+ person film screening event through restaurant partnership with MIAN (restaurant chian), demonstrating ability to scale operations and manage complex logistics.

## The Pivot

After 4 months in commercial kitchen operations, I pivoted to restaurant partnerships and event catering, including a 300+ person film screening event. This shift taught me how to adapt business models based on real market feedback rather than initial assumptions.

**Operations ceased in August 2024** as I transitioned to graduate studies, but the experience fundamentally shaped how I approach operational complexity and stakeholder management.

## What I Learned

The most valuable insight: **systems that work in theory require constant adaptation in practice**. Every metric—from ingredient costs to delivery times to customer satisfaction—became a lesson in translating business assumptions into measurable outcomes.

This experience taught me to embrace failure as data, pivot based on evidence, and maintain quality standards even when scaling doesn't go as planned.
