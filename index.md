## A Bit About Me

i grew up in a demolished neighborhood in shanghai and moved to the u.s. alone at 17.

since then, i earned a double major in computational & systems biology and neuroscience from ucla, and founded [rono dumplings](rono-dumplings.html) — a food business where i turned childhood memories into recipes, and operations into data.  

those endeavors aren't built over days but decades of treading on the path as goal. 

beyond data and systems, i paint, speak three languages, and bring international perspective from years living between shanghai, los angeles, and germany.
