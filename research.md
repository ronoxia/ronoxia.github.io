### Now

Right now, Iâ€™m preparing for my masterâ€™s capstone in biomedical data science â€” likely focused on genomic or physiological signal data. This time around, the questions feel bigger, but so does the clarity.

### Past 

Most of my formal research experience started in undergrad â€” and Iâ€™ll admit, parts of it now feel like a first pancake: a little uneven, but still worth making.

What I took seriously, though, was the process of learning how to model systems â€” how assumptions, simplifications, and math can give structure to noisy biological processes. That foundation still shapes how I think today.



### Synaptic Transmission & Depression  
**Project:** Modeling short-term synaptic depression  
**Lab:** Mehta Lab @ UCLA  
**Advisor:** Prof. Mayank Mehta

We reproduced published kinetic models of short-term synaptic depression using Python and differential equations (ODEINT). Our implementation simulated vesicle depletion and recovery dynamics at depression-dominated synapses, modeling how release probability decreases with sustained presynaptic activity. The model captured frequency-dependent synaptic filtering, demonstrating how postsynaptic responses reach steady-state amplitude that scales inversely with input frequency - creating a frequency-dependent filter that maintains signal fidelity within the synapse's operating range.
