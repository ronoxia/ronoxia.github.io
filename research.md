### Now

Right now, Iâ€™m preparing for my masterâ€™s capstone in biomedical data science â€” likely focused on genomic or physiological signal data. This time around, the questions feel bigger, but so does the clarity.

### Past 

Most of my formal research experience started in undergrad â€” and Iâ€™ll admit, parts of it now feel like a first pancake: a little uneven, but still worth making.

What I took seriously, though, was the process of learning how to model systems â€” how assumptions, simplifications, and math can give structure to noisy biological processes. That foundation still shapes how I think today.



### Synaptic Transmission & Depression  
**Project:** Modeling short-term synaptic depression  
**Lab:** Mehta Lab @ UCLA  
**Advisor:** Prof. Mayank Mehta

I implemented a simplified kinetic model of synaptic depression using Python and ODEs â€” simulating how the probability of neurotransmitter release changes with repeated spikes. It was messy and manual and not always elegant, but it taught me how to test a model against intuition and push beyond just "making it run."
